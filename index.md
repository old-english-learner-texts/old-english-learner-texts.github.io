The _Old English Learner Texts Project_ is a collaborative effort to produce openly-licensed, annotated texts in Old&nbsp;English for extensive reading.

We're just getting started, using the model of the [Greek Learner Texts Project](https://greek-learner-texts.org) and sharing a lot of the same tools.

## What We're Producing

* openly-licensed, high-quality, citable base texts in a standard, machine-actionable format
* tooling which produces online and print versions of the texts
* corpus-based vocabulary lists for language learners (and producers of graded Old English reading material)
* linguistic annotation necessary to do things like track vocabulary, produce context-specific glosses, etc.

## Who We Are

* James Tauber
* Sarah Monnier
